<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
    As a thinker by nature I have since start and until continually enjoyed Software Quality Assurance (SQA) and all that it encompasses. When someone asks me how I would describe my job I always reploy with one word, "FUN!" As a new graduate in 2007 up until today I continue to enjoy learning, mentoring and the challenges that SQA brings. As the requirements in software changes so have the job requirements for todays SQA job which has lead me to take my next direction and new passion in Web Development. I am quickly learning that Automatin and Web Devleopment are quite different so learning how to build a website from the ground up and then utilizing automation to test it just seemed like the next knowledgeable step.
